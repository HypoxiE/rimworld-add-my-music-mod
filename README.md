# Add my music, please! mod for rimworld

## A short guide

To add your music, you just need to drop your music into the Sounds\Gameplay\ folder and run the add_my_music.bat script. After that, the Defs\SongDefs\Songs_Gameplay.xml file will be automatically overwritten and after you enable the mod in the game, your music will appear there.
